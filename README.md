## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 - ðŸ”­ MSc student in Artificial Intelligence for the Creative Industries at the University of York, specializing in generative AI, mechanistic interpretability, and AI alignment. My work focuses on building capable, efficient, and transparent AI systems, particularly for agentic characters in interactive environments.

My MSc thesis research led to a key discovery in efficient fine-tuning. I demonstrated that a minimal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, which trained only 2.43% of a hybrid Transformer-SSM's parameters, achieved long-context reasoning performance on par with a full fine-tune. Through mechanistic analysis using linear probes, I provided evidence for a "representation vs. utilization" distinction, concluding that the fine-tuning unlocked the model's latent skill to act upon pre-existing knowledge rather than teaching it new information. I am now building on this by exploring techniques like GraphRAG to provide agents with rich, contextual world knowledge and building systems where the AI can transparently explain its in-game decisions.

Beyond language models, I have hands-on experience with a range of generative and analytical techniques. I have engineered and trained Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to generate art from specific colour palettes and researched methods for achieving stylistic consistency in text-to-image diffusion models like SDXL. Additionally, I have developed a player scouting system for womenâ€™s football using unsupervised clustering algorithms to identify player archetypes from performance data.

Underpinning all my work is a strong focus on AI ethics and safety. I wrote an academic paper on the risks of "dishonest anthropomorphism," analyzing how deploying human-like AI in monetized applications can amplify risks such as problem gambling. I believe that as we develop more sophisticated AI, ensuring these systems are transparent, aligned with human values, and robustly safe is a critical responsibility.

I am graduating in January 2026 and am driven to contribute to the development of safe and beneficial artificial intelligence.
